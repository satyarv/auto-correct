# ðŸ”§ Spell Checker & Sentence Corrector in Python

A lightweight, pureâ€‘Python implementation of a **spell checker** based on
Peter Norvigâ€™s editâ€‘distance algorithm.  
Given a sentence, it generates candidate corrections that are **one edit
distance** away (insertion, deletion, substitution, transposition) and
returns the most probable word from a large corpus.

## ðŸ“Œ How It Works
1. **Corpus**  
   Loads `big.txt` (1â€¯MB of publicâ€‘domain text) and builds a wordâ€“frequency
   dictionary with `Counter`.
2. **Editâ€‘Distance Generation**  
   - **Insertion** of a letter  
   - **Deletion** of a letter  
   - **Substitution** of a letter  
   - **Transposition** of adjacent letters
3. **Probability Ranking**  
   Chooses the candidate with the highest frequency in the corpus.
4. **Sentence Correction**  
   Applies wordâ€‘level correction across all tokens in a sentence.
